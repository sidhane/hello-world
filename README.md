hello world,

Ram Gurung here. during my work period in a ISP company i later realized that i am more interested in coding rather doing
networking, cabling etc. i have learned basic programming concepts of my own. i am always ready to learn no matter in which level
should i have to dive. i am passionated in this coding world. thank you all.
